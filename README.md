## Introduction

Welcome to our BAMX Logistics Management proposal (final name pending). This app is designed with the purpose of enhancing and streamlining the interaction between BAMX and its commercial donators (providers). 

This app intends to help with the logistics behind the food bank, as well as the other associated BAMX services, such as the clothing and medicine bank, managing tasks such as donation cargos, shipments, routes, and inventory.

With this app, BAMX will ensure the timely notification, transportation, collection, and management of donations and goods.

This README file provides an overview of the apps features and usage guidelines.

## Features
With this application, any given provider of any of the markets mentioned above, will be able to generate donation requests or proposals. Stating which is the item to donate, as well as additional information such as the amount of the item and expiration date. Should the proposal be accepted by BAMX, the provider will recieve a notification regarding the pick-up date and time. These suppliers will also be able to view all the previous donations they have ever done.

In addition to the mobile app, there will also be a web page aimed for the BAMX administrators. In this web page, BAMX can recieve all the donation proposals from any provider, evaluate them and decide wether they should accept or deny them (depending on aspects such as the expiration date of the product). The BAMX admin will also be able to visualize through the web page the current and future pick-up schedules and a possible route to gather all the corresponding products in an efficient way. However it is up to BAMX wether to follow these routes, or perform their own.
